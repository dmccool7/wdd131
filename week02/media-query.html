            <h2>D&C 21:4-6</h2>
            <p>
                "4 Wherefore, meaning the church, thou shalt give heed unto all his words and commandments which he shall give unto you as he receiveth them, walking in all holiness before me;
                5 For his word ye shall receive, as if from mine own mouth, in all patience and faith.
                6 For by doing these things the gates of hell shall not prevail against you; yea, and the Lord God will disperse the powers of darkness from before you, and cause the heavens to shake for your good, and his name’s glory."
